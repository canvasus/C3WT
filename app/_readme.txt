Patch Manager for C3WT synth
Requirements: Python >3.6 (+ possibly additional requirements?)

Run with "patchManager.bat"

The C3WT port should be detected if it is connected and powered on
The top indicator should turn green if the connection is ok

Select "Upload patches..." and browse to an existing file.
The new patch data will replace the current patch data in the C3WT,
however only as a local copy and NOT stored on the SD
Store new patches permanently on the SD as usual.

If the app is running and connection is green, using the "export" function
on the C3WT will transfer the currently active patch data to the PC.
This will create a patch data file in the app folder, with the name of the patch.
